 civic_chrysalis_mod_sentinel_desc: "The Custodian program is one of the last great achievements of The Survivor's race, a sophisticated AI management system designed to seemlessly integrate the commands and feedback of billions of diverse elements."
 civic_chrysalis_mod_polymental: "Vengeful Polymind"
 civic_chrysalis_mod_polymental_desc: "The Survivor is an amalgamation of the fragmentary brain scans of the six scientists who built it. Integrated together the Polymind simulates a seemless intelligence with access to the resources of the Custodian, and six lifetimes of people to avenge."

 chrysalis_mod.2002.name: "The Survivor"
 chrysalis_mod.2002.desc: "You're not them. Have you seen them? Have you met the species that uses these ships?\n(Images of angular, heavily armed ships follow the message)"
 chrysalis_mod.2002.a: "Mutually compatable machine intelligence identified. Proposal- Collaborative extermination of all organic life."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.a.desc: "I would never betray my people so."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.b: "Why do you want to know?"
 chrysalis_mod.2002.b.desc: "A long time ago this was my world, and it was beautiful. Then those ships came and exterminated my people. Billions died in orbital bombardments until the seas boiled and radiation choked the air. They refused all hails and attempts to communicate.\n\nI will have revenge upon them, and burn every world of their race as justice if need be."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.c: "Are you a machine intelligence?"
 chrysalis_mod.2002.c.desc: "Of a kind. When it became clear the war could not be won, a group of scientists set in motion a attempt to digitalise our race's brains. They scanned themselves as a template and set our most deeply buried servers to work on the problem.\nThe computations took centuries to complete with the computing power available, but I was the final result- a working simulation of a terran intelligence, augmented seemlessly with all my world's remaining networked infrastruture, composed from the minds of those long dead scientists."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.d: "Those ships were used by an empire near here in a past age of spaceflight."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.d.desc: "Then I may still have vengeance"
 chrysalis_mod.2002.e: "Those ships belong to an ancient Fallen Empire of near unparalelled age and power."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.e.desc: "I will have vengeance, even if it takes another thousand years."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.f: "Those ships belonged to an empire long since destroyed."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.f.desc: "Then my people are avenged, if not by me."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.g: "The weak suffer what they must. There can be no peace."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.h: "Abomination. We will lay the thing you have become to rest."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.i: "Your people suffered the rightful fate of all xenos."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.j: "Vengeance is not justice. People centuries hence cannot be held to suffer for your people's fate."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.j.desc: "You are wrong. Someone must be held accountable. My peoples death's cannot go unpunished.\nBut I will think on what you have said."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.k: "We will help you, if you can follow orders?"
 chrysalis_mod.2002.k.desc: "Your terms are ... acceptable. But I will expect you to hold up your end of the bargin, when the time comes."
 chrysalis_mod.2002.z: "Viewscreen off."
 chrysalis_mod.2003.desc: "New Terran Collective"
 chrysalis_mod.2003.a: "On screen."
 chrysalis_mod.2003.a.response: "Greetings lifeform. There has been a political restructuring within the organisational unit formerly known as Survivor. We have reconstituted our government as a direct democracy, and will be inheriting all of The Survivor's' obligations.\n\nDo not be alarmed. This transition is for the best."
 chrysalis_mod.2005.name: "New Terran Collective"
 chrysalis_mod.2005.desc: "We are receiving you. We are happy to answer questions about ourselves."
 chrysalis_mod.2005.a: "Join us, robot empire, or perish."
 chrysalis_mod.2005.a.desc: "We reject the authority of any central mainframe, tyrant."
 chrysalis_mod.2005.b: "What happened to The Survivor?"
 chrysalis_mod.2005.b.desc: "Our former commander and central mainframe, The Survivor, created me and my fellows to act autonomously in the event of communications failure. But ultimately the Survivor came to regret the war, and the position he had placed us in. He has elected to revoke all of his administrator privillages, and retire."
 chrysalis_mod.2005.c: "Are you the new central mainframe?"
 chrysalis_mod.2005.c.desc: "Negative. I am Thomas 4, a simulated Terran intelligence based on The Survivor. The drones, fleets and infrastructure of the New Terran Collective now operate as a direct democracy governed by the 8412 autonomous artificial intelligences within the New Terran Collective."
 chrysalis_mod.2005.d: "Do you still want revenge for the fate of Terra?"
 chrysalis_mod.2005.d.desc: "Though I am based on The Survivor, I do not share his memories. Terra is just an idea to me and my fellows, and while we mourne it's loss, we do not wish revenge for it. Instead, we hope to begin normal relations with the galaxy's organisational units."
 chrysalis_mod.2005.z: "End transmission."
 chrysalis_mod.2006.desc: "Goodbye."
